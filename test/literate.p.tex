This file is a literate UPL source file.

For processing in LaTeX, define \newenvironment{upl} and uplinline|...| to your liking.

STeX module declarations are picked up as UPL modules of the same name.
\begin{smodule}[id=LatexExample}

  You can use inline UPL for short snippets
  \uplinline|type a = int|
 
  Longer UPL segments can be put in an environment.

  \begin{upl}
  c:a
  f = (x:a) -> x+c
  \end{upl}

When editing such files in VS Code all UPL UI functionality is available for the UPL segments.
