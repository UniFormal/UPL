This folder contains commented examples for quickly learning UPL.

See "all.pp" for the proejct file for this example folder.

The file basics.p should be read first as it explains the general syntax.
The other files describe specialized aspects.

Of particular interest are the following:

Theories:
- theories.p: basics of theories (including axioms and proofs)
- algebra.p: theories as types - applied to algebra
- quoting.p: theories as languages - applied to numbers
- type_classes.p: theories as type classes

Formalization:
- logic_encodings.p: logical framework-style definitions of proof systems
- numbers.p: axiomatizations of theories
- notations.p: defining infix operators and similar notations

Special uses:
- literate.p.tex: literate programming with UPL inside tex files
- nb.p.notebook: Jupyter-style notebooks for UPL, usable in VS Code
